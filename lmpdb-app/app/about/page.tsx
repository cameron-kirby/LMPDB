              <p>All listings are of alleged wrongdoings, alongside submitted pieces of evidence to support the claims made.</p>

              <p>Every piece of information provided by the LMPDB is crowdsourced by members of its respective community.</p>

              <p>All allegations are vetted via an anonymous group of unbiased individuals.</p>

              <p>Some allegations contain more evidence than others. For the protection of the LMPDB, it is ultimately up to the discretion of the body behind the LMPDB if certain allegations will be listed.</p>

            <AccordionItem key="2" aria-label="Accordion 2" title="Can listings be redacted?">
              <p>To prevent malicious actors in communities, every listing is subject to modification and/or redaction when sufficient evidence is provided in contradiction to the reported allegation. </p>

            <AccordionItem key="3" aria-label="Accordion 3" title="Anonymity">
              <p>There are many reasons why a victim would wish to remain anonymous when levying allegations against problematic individuals in a community. The LMPDB will respect these wishes when requested.</p>
